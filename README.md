# About Me

üëã About Me

Hello, I'm Bria Brown‚Äîa Master's student in the Data Analytics and Data Engineering program at Western Governors University. With four years of experience as an educator, I'm now transitioning into the field of data analytics and engineering. My passion lies in transforming data into actionable insights and building solutions that support smarter decision-making.

Immediately below is the work I‚Äôve completed through my graduate program. If you‚Äôre looking for independent, hands-on projects outside of my coursework, please visit the Personal Projects section.

üìÅ WGU_Portfolio

This repository is a collection of projects I‚Äôve completed during my MSDADE program at WGU. The purpose of this portfolio is to:

Showcase my technical and analytical skills to potential employers

Serve as a helpful reference for current or prospective students in the program

Each project folder includes documentation, code, and explanations that reflect my learning and growth in data analytics and engineering.
